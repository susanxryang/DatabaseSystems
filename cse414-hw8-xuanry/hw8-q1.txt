I write the sql to with 2 "WITH" statement. One with statement I uses to compute the number of 
outcoming for each city and the other with statement is used to count the number of incoming flights
to each city. Then I join these to temporary relation together base on dest_city = origin_city,
and compute the influx by number of incoming flights minus outcoming flights. Then I sort them asc and
get the smallest one and then sort by desc to get the biggest one.
Here is the explicit sql query I wrote for finding that.

WITH DPT AS (SELECT F1.origin_city, COUNT(*) cnt1
             FROM Flights F1
             GROUP BY F1.origin_city),
ARRV AS (SELECT F2.dest_city, COUNT(*) cnt2
         FROM Flights F2
         GROUP BY F2.dest_city),
FluxList AS (SELECT D.origin_city, A.dest_city, ISNULL(A.cnt2, 0) - ISNULL(D.cnt1, 0) as influx
             FROM DPT D FULL OUTER JOIN ARRV A
             ON D.origin_city = A.dest_city),
MaxMin AS (SELECT MAX(FL.influx) maximum, MIN(FL.influx) minimum
           FROM FluxList FL)
SELECT FL1.origin_city, FL1.dest_city, FL1.influx
FROM FluxList FL1, MaxMin M
WHERE FL1.influx = M.maximum
OR FL1.influx = M.minimum;
