I ran this query to get results:
DROP TABLE PRIZE
CREATE TABLE Prize(id int, firstname TEXT, surname TEXT, born TEXT, died TEXT, bornCountry TEXT, bornCountryCode TEXT,
					bornCity TEXT, diedCountry TEXT, diedCountryCode TEXT, diedCity TEXT, gender TEXT, year int, category TEXT,
					overallMotivation TEXT, share int, 	motivation TEXT, name TEXT, city TEXT, country TEXT);
.mode csv
.import laureate.csv Prize
with allGendersCounts as(
SELECT COUNT(*) as count, P.category as category FROM Prize P WHERE P.gender != "org" GROUP BY category
),
femaleCounts as (
SELECT COUNT(*) as count, P.category as category FROM Prize P WHERE P.gender = "female" GROUP BY category
)
SELECT F.category as category, CAST(ROUND((F.count / (G.count * 1.0)) * 100.0, 0) AS INT) as percentFemale FROM femaleCounts F, allGendersCounts G WHERE F.category = G.category;

I first downloaded the Laureate table CSV file so I could run my own queries on it. From there, I created a table and imported
the data into it. For my query, I had a temporary table that had the count of all winners in each category, and a temporary
table that the count of all female winners in each category. I selected the number of female winners divided by the number
of total winners for each category, multiplied it by 100, rounded it, and cast it to an int to get the nearest whole number percent.
