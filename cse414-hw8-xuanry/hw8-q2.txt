To get the out degrees of cities put into bins, I ran this query:

SELECT F.origin_city, (COUNT(*) / 100) * 100 as bin FROM Flights F GROUP BY F.origin_city;

This selected the city and the number of flights departing from it. I divided the count by 100 and then mulitplied by 100
to take advantage of integer division to split the counts into bins of 100, so any city with less than 100 flights would have
"bin" be 0, any city with more than 100 but less than 200 would have its bin be 100, etc.

From this query, I created a temporary table and ran this query:

with bins as 
(SELECT F.origin_city, (COUNT(*) / 100) * 100 as bin FROM Flights F GROUP BY F.origin_city)
SELECT b.bin, COUNT(*) as num FROM bins b GROUP BY b.bin;

This grouped by the bin and selected the number of cities that lie in that bin.
I outputted the result of the query to a CSV file and plotted it on https://scatterplot.online/
