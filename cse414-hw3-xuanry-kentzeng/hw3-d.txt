One of the advantages of a DBMS service in a public cloud is that you don't have to worry about your database
being lost. Teams and individuals can also get a better computing ability with a paid cloud service. Personal
computers also may not have the ability to deal with the large amount of data that is stored on the cloud and
thus by using the public cloud services, teams and individuals can solve the issue of a lack of computing ability
by utilizing the powerful computing ability of DBMS services in a public cloud.

A disadvantage is that DBMS services in a public cloud, such as Microsoft Azure, cost money and personal projects
would not be feasible to complete on a DBMS service in a public cloud unless one has sufficient monetary funds to do so.
Another disadvantage of a public cloud service is that the efficiency of database actions depend on a large
part to the internet and connectivity of an individual's personal computer.
