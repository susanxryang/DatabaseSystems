1. All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.
A -> A
B -> B
C -> C
D -> D
There is no functional dependencies other than the trivial one. The subsets of {A,B,C,D}
are closed, thus the subsets cannot have nontrivial functional dependencies.

2. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.
A -> B
B -> C
C -> D
D -> A

3. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.
A -> D
B -> C
C -> B
D -> BC
